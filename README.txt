Commerce Product Bundle
-----------------------

This module provides for Drupal Commerce a product bundling functionality.

You can define products that consists of other  products. The customer can 
select from different  sub products. This is similar to the core attribute 
functionality with the  difference that the customer  can select  multiple 
products in on one page.

The bundle  is then  represented by  one order line item.  This allows the
maximum  compatibility  with  other  modules  such as  shipping or payment 
modules.

Installation
------------
Install the  module  as  usual.  Then setup  a  product  with  to  product 
references. Set in  the display formatter of  these  reference  fields the 
"Bundle  Product: Add  to cart form"  formatter.  Reference  the  products 
accordingly to the created references.
